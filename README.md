# shaman
Track TV shows

## Example
See demo application without installing anything:
http://mbezjak.github.com/shaman

## Install
(1) Download and extract latest `tar.gz`
[release](https://github.com/mbezjak/shaman/releases). (2) Run `shaman` command:

    $ ./shaman
    # or
    $ python2 shaman

(2.1) Alternatively you can just open `index.html` in your browser. This is
equivalent to visiting [demo](http://mbezjak.github.com/shaman/) application. By
opening html directly in a browser shaman stores data in `localStorage` instead
of on file system.

## Required dependencies
When running `shaman` command dependencies are:

 * python 2.7 (probably works with lower version as well)
 * [pyqt](http://riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro) module

When opening `index.html` there are no dependencies besides modern browser - no
IE8 or below!
